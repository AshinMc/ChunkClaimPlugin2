# ChunkClaimPlugin2
 A complete rewrite of my ChunkClaimPlugin for Spigot 1.21.4

## Commands
1. /claimchunk: Claim the chunk you are standing in.
2. /unclaimchunk: Unclaim the chunk you are standing in.
3. /checkchunk: Check the ownership of the chunk you are standing in.
4. /infochunk: Get a list of your claimed chunks.
5. /visualizechunk: Visualize the borders of the chunk you are standing in.

## Version 0.2
1. Added fixed all bugs and rewrote everything for 1.21.4.
2. Made it so other players cannot break anything in your claims.
3. Added a config file for extra customization

## Future Plans
1. Giving other players access to your chunks.
2. Maybe have it be visible on map of some sort?
3. Admin commands to manage players.
4. Adding more features to config file?

Let me know if you want me to add anymore features
