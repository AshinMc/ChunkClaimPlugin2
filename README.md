# ChunkClaimPlugin2
 **A complete rewrite of my ChunkClaimPlugin for Spigot 1.21.4.**
 
 ChunkClaimPlugin is a plugin for Minecraft Spigot/Paper Servers to allow players to claim chunks, which protects their property within and also help manage it.

## 📜 Commands
1. /claimchunk: Claim the chunk you are standing in.
2. /unclaimchunk: Unclaim the chunk you are standing in.
3. /checkchunk: Check the ownership of the chunk you are standing in.
4. /infochunk: Get a list of your claimed chunks.
5. /visualizechunk: Visualize the borders of the chunk you are standing in.

## ✅ Version 0.3 (Working on Currently)
1. Adding WorldGuard integration. [Done]
2. Soon....


## 🛠️ Future Plans
1. Giving other players access to your chunks.
2. Maybe have it be visible on map of some sort?
3. Admin commands to manage players.
4. Adding more features to config file?
5. A proper gui rewrite?
6More to come!

Let me know if you want me to add anymore features!
