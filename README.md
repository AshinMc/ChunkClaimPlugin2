# ChunkClaimPlugin2
 A complete rewrite of my ChunkClaimPlugin for Spigot 1.21.4

## Commands
1. /claimchunk: Claim the chunk you are standing in.
2. /unclaimchunk: Unclaim the chunk you are standing in.
3. /checkchunk: Check the ownership of the chunk you are standing in.
4. /infochunk: Get a list of your claimed chunks.
5. /visualizechunk: Visualize the borders of the chunk you are standing in.

## Version 0.2
1. Added fixed all bugs and rewrote everything for 1.21.4.
2. Made it so other players cannot break anything in your claims.
